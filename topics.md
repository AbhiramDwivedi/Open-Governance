* **Session Title**: Docker Development Workshop (part 1)
 * **Preferred Timeframe**: Evening
 * **Event Type**: 2 hour workshop (hands-on!) - 1st in a potential series (others include, Deploying to ECS, Deploying to ACS, Using Docker for CI; Talks that are related are Docker Networking, Docker Volumes)
 * **Summary**: Using Docker during the development process has several advantages. We can use or create a container that has the libraries and tools we need installed, and use it to build and run our app. We don’t have them on our host computer, and we can spin up an environment with multiple services and a database in minutes, with one command. We can then share this environment with our teammates via the Docker images or in a code repo, so we can ensure they have the same things installed and can get up and running quickly.First, we will go over the basics of Docker and containers. Then, we will go through the process of creating an image, and tweaking it in order to get the dependencies we need to start developing. Then, we will build upon a scaffolded app with it building and running in a Docker container. We will go through the entire development workflow with Docker in the mix. We will then go through the very basics of deploying these containers that encompass your new app to the cloud.
