 * **Preferred Timeframe**:  February 15
 * **Event Type**: 1-2 Hour Workshop
 * **Summary**: In this talk we are going to talk about using Firebase 2 as a back end and database solution for web apps. In particular we will focus on how it interfaces with Angular 2 through AngularFire 2. The first half of the talk will be a presentation that discusses the benefits and issues with using Firebase. These will include ease of setup, speed of development, how well it interfaces with Angular 2, as well as others. The second half of the talk will be a demo that creates a small chat app from scratch.

* **Session Title**: Do More with Less Javascript - (AngularJS DC co-hosted event)
 * **Preferred Timeframe**:  March 15th, 2017
 * **Event Type**: 50-min
 * **Summary**: JavaScript moves at the light of speed. Moving that fast may burn you, hard! Focusing on minimal tooling, and fewer frameworks will allow you to become an expert by going deeper, rather than stretching yourself too thin while achieving better results. I'll talk about why Angular 2, npm and TypeScript are the right technologies to focus on in 2017. There'll be three segments to the talk. First a 5 minute dry-run of my Ng-Conf 2017 talk and second 30 minutes elaboration of the topic, followed by Q+A with the audience.
